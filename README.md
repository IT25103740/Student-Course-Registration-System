# 🎓 University Semester Module Registration System

Welcome to the **Semester Module Registration and Waitlist Management System**. Our project is a centralized portal for university students, designed to manage seat allocations and waitlists seamlessly. 

It completely handles high-volume student requests without a database by utilizing theoretical concepts like **Insertion Sort** and **FIFO Queues** over a flat-file storage system, ensuring a smooth and fair enrollment process.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Student Portal:** User-friendly interface for students to enroll in modules and track academic progress.
* **Smart Waitlist Radar:** Automatically manages module capacities using a **FIFO Queue** data structure.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Chronologically organizes all incoming requests using the **Insertion Sort** algorithm for easy approval.
* **Real-Time Notifications:** Instant pop-up alerts for students when an admin makes a decision (Powered by JavaScript LocalStorage).
* **Data Analytics:** Live charts representing academic progress and server capacity (Powered by Chart.js).
* **Database-Less Storage:** Efficient File I/O (`.txt` files) handling for continuous data persistence.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JSP (JavaServer Pages)
* **Backend:** Core Java, Java Servlets
* **Logic & Data:** Custom FileHandler (`.txt`), FIFO Queues, Insertion Sort
* **Libraries:** SweetAlert2 (Popups), Chart.js (Analytics)
